# Matrix Operations (Addition/Subtraction/Inverse/Scalar)
A program capable of multiplying by a scalar-adding-subtracting-and finding the inverse of a matrix. The program was written for my Data Structure foundations course. It's more sophisticated because adding matrices is more complex of a task than simply multiplying. I was also able to compute the invere of a 2x2 matrice.
